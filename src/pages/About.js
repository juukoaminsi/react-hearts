              <p>
                Touched Hearts began with a simple act of kindness. In 2010, Sarah Namukasa returned 
                to her home village in Uganda after completing her education abroad. She was struck by 
                the challenges facing the children there â€“ limited access to education, inadequate 
                healthcare, and few opportunities for advancement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sarah started by helping a small group of children attend school, providing them with 
                uniforms, books, and school fees. Word of her efforts spread, and soon local community 
                members joined to help more children. This grassroots initiative quickly grew as more 
                people recognized the need and the impact of these efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 2012, the initiative had formalized into Touched Hearts, a registered non-profit 
                organization. The organization expanded its focus beyond education to include healthcare, 
                clean water access, and community development programs. Today, Touched Hearts operates 
                across multiple regions in Uganda, having touched the lives of over 100,000 individuals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our journey continues as we work toward a future where every child in Uganda has the 
                opportunity to realize their potential and every community has the resources to thrive.
